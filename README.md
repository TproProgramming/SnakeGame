# Snake Game
### Prerequisites
  Python 3.x
  Pygame library

There is currently an error with the snake colliding with itself. I commented out the problem for the mean time. The problem occurs when it checks for the snake making contact with itself. If i dont comment out that part of the code the game ends when the snake gets the first piece of food.
