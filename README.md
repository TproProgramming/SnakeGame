# SnakeGame
This code creates a simple snake game using Python and Pygame. The snake can be controlled by the arrow keys. The snake grows when it eats food. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
The game also displays a scoreboard. the user gets +1 everytime they collect a piece of food.

To run this game you need to have python and pygame installed.
To install pygame go to your command prompt and type in 'pip install pygame'.

There is currently an error with the snake colliding with itself. I commented out the problem for the mean time. The problem occurs when it checks for the snake making contact with itself. If i dont comment out that part of the code the game ends when the snake gets the first piece of food.
